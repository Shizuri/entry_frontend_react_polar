## Magic the Gathering card browser

Created with React Hooks, React Router, Context API and React multi select component.

This is a version of the web app that uses only JSX / HTML built in forms. Many of them are difficult to work with and style.
Because of this there is an advanced, version 2 variant of this project that uses a custom multi select form. I consider that one to be the final and representative version of this project.
