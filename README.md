## Magic the Gathering card browser

This web app welcomes a user that can browse, sort and filter 100 random Magic the Gathering cards provided from and API.

Created with React Hooks, React Router, Context API and React multi select component.

This is a version of the web app that uses only JSX / HTML built in forms. Many of them are difficult to work with and style.
Because of this there is an advanced, version 2 variant of this project that uses a custom multi select form. I consider that one to be the final and representative version of this project.
